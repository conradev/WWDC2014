## About

I am a **17 year old** high school student from New Jersey, and I live 20 minutes outside of **Philadelphia**. I've been working with iOS for **four years** now.

Last summer, I worked at **Airbnb** on the iOS 7 update of their iPhone app. I am currently working on two apps, **DeskConnect** and **Workflow**.

When I am not traveling to **hackathons**, I can be found not doing homework and attending monthly **PhillyCocoa** meetings.
